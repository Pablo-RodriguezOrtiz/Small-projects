# Small-projects
Some small projects I do while I study Data Science. There will be a variety of codes about a variety of themes because I'm still learning about Python and it's potential.

Probably all codes can be improved easy, and I would love if you test it and report me the issues you had (if you had them) to let me work on them and improve my skills and codes.
