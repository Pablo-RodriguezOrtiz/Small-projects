# Small-projects
Some small projects I do while I study Data Science. There will be a variety of codes about a variety of themes because I'm still learning about Python and it's potential.

Probably all codes can be improved easy, and I would love if you test it and report me the issues you had (if you had them) to let me work on them and improve my skills and codes.

All my code is based on spanish language, but sometimes I use some english words for my variables. My comments are easy to understand and with a basic structure. If you need to understand them I guess google translate will do a perfect work!
